# Disney Films
## Goal
Build a Website to Display your favorite Disney Films

## What you will learn

- How to structure and style a webpage with HTML.
- How to add text, images, and even GIFs to your page.



## Tasks


1. Build a simple Website
- Create a HTML website using tags `<h1> <h2> <p>` to display up to 5 films with a title, description, your thoughts about the film and an image or a gif for each.

** You should be able to see your website on the browser **


2. Adding Syle with CSS

Now that your webpage is working, let’s make it look even better! You’ll use CSS to style your webpage, changing colors, fonts, and more.

- add backgroud colour to your website
- add font-size and colour
- add margin
- any other things you want to make it look nice!

** Make sure to apply your styling to the html file **

Example code

```
body {
    background-color: lavender;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: darkblue;
}
```


3.  Add Interactivity with JavaScript

Add JavaScript functionality to make the page interactive, such as toggling descriptions of movies. Javascript is a language that essentially triggers a change to the page with an event.

 - Add a "toggle description" button below each movie
 - Create a Javascript function that hides/shows the movie description when clicked
